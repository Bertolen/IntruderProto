Hey guys! I really have no idea who you might be since I don't think I'm ever gonna give this link to anyone. But well since you're going thourgh the trouble of reading this I might aswell tell you whet this repo is all about :)

So first things first, this is an video game project, made with UE4. Meaning that if you have Unreal Engine 4 installed on your computer you can always clone this repository and improve what i'm making here so far. Currently I'm working with UE 4.18.1 (latest to date)

The game's final goal is to make a first person stealth game. Some of the games that serve as inspiration for this project are Styx : Master of Shadows and Dishonored.
I'd like Thief to the list but I've never played that game or even seen someone play it. It's on my to-do list.

This project is still a huge work in progress so I'm not gonna tell you more about it since everything might change really quick and I don't wanna be caught doing empty promises. Besides, so far the game is pretty empty (there's just a basic usable objects system and some AI, nothing to get hyped over).

If you have any questions I'll be glad (and surprised) to answer them!

With regards,

Bertolen
